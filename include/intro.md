Welcome to the Cashu Book of NUTs. This book is nuts. It is a streamlined guide to the Cashu Notation, Usage, and Terminology (NUTs).

I want to be clear: I didn’t write the NUTs. All the credit goes to the original authors and contributors of these notes. My contribution has been to organize these NUTs into a single larger document.

Thanks for picking up this book! I hope it helps you navigate the exciting waters of Cashu more easily and encourages you to dive deeper into this innovative project. Let’s explore and build the future of decentralized communication together!
